Title: Stories in Python
    Go to the following link to try out this code:
    programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/

In this Python script, we will be practicing making Python wait for a period of time just like how Scratch waits for a certain number of seconds.
'''
# This script will use the time module that is built in to Python. Thus, we need the import time statement below to use the time.sleep() function later for waiting.
import time

# Now the story can begin:
print("Once upon a time...")
time.sleep(3) # Waits for 3 seconds
print("There was a dog named Pete.")
time.sleep(3)
print("He was a very good boy.")
